# Friends in Flats: Frontend Challenge

Welcome to the Friends in Flats frontend challenge! We're excited to see your skills in action. This challenge is designed to test your understanding of user experience, frontend development, and data processing.

## Challenge Overview

Your task is to create a feature that allows users to find their perfect flat. This will involve creating an interactive element (like a button) that, when clicked, guides the user through a process to gather information about their preferences. Based on this information, the system should then display the flats that best match the user's criteria. In the current case, no backend logic is present, so the matching should just happen randomly.

Many components from the webpage were removed, and only the logic needed for the challenge remains. Try to follow the layout and color scheme of the components already present on the page.
The "Frontend_challenge_schema.png" contains a small schematic overview of the whole task as well.

## Detailed Requirements

1. **Interactive Element**:
   - Design and implement an interactive element (e.g., a button) labeled "Find the Perfect Flat".
   - This element should be prominently placed so users can easily find and interact with it.

2. **Information Gathering**:
   - Upon interacting with the element, present the user with a series of questions or a survey to gather information about their flat preferences. This could be in the form of a modal, a new page, or any other user-friendly method.
   - Some suggested questions include:
     - What is your budget range?
     - How many bedrooms do you require?
     - Do you need a pet-friendly flat?
     - Preferred location or area?
     - Any specific amenities? (e.g., gym, swimming pool, parking)
   - Feel free to add any other questions you believe would be relevant.

3. **Processing and Displaying Results**:
   - Once the user has provided their preferences, process this information to filter and display the list of available flats that best match their criteria.
   - The list should contain links to the listed flats or could also be made out of predefined components like the already implemented room cards.
   - As no backend logic will be present, after the survey is submitted and saved somewhere (feel free to be creative), the listed rooms should just be randomly listed as no matching algorithm will be present.

## Technical Requirements

- You should use the frontend library React.
- Ensure your solution is mobile-responsive.
- Consider accessibility and usability best practices.
- Your code should be clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.
- The style of the layout should fit the existing one.

## Submission

1. Fork this public repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Implement your solution on a new branch, e.g., "feature/my-solution" or "challenge-solution".
3. Once you're satisfied with your implementation, push your changes to your forked repository.
4. From your forked repository, create a pull request against the "main" branch of the original repository.
5. In your pull request description, provide a brief overview of your approach and any instructions needed to run and test your solution..

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does the solution work as expected?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-organized, and easy to understand?
- **User Experience**: Is the solution easy to use and visually appealing?
- **Innovation**: Did you introduce any unique features or approaches?

## Conclusion

We're excited to see your solution! This challenge is a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and creativity. Remember, there's no single "correct" solution, so feel free to think outside the box and come up with innovative ideas.

Good luck!
